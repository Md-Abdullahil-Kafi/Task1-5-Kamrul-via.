// Task 3: Constants vs. Variables
// Objective: Understand the difference between let and const.
// Instructions:
// Create a const variable birthYear with the year you were born (e.g., 1999).
// Create a let variable currentYear with the value 2025.
// Log both to the console.
// Try reassigning birthYear to a new value (e.g., 2000) and see what happens.
// Change currentYear to 2026 and log it again.


const birthYear = 2002;
var currentYear = 2025;
let myName = "Abdullahil Kafi"; 

const birthYear = 2004;
var currentYear = 2026;
//  myName = "Md. Abdullahil Kafi";

console.log(`Hello, My name is ${myName}. my birth year is ${birthYear} and current year is${currentYear}`)
